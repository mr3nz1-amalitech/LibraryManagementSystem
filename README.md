# Library Management System

### Objectives:

1. Implement a comprehensive library management system.
2. Apply object-oriented programming principles.
3. Utilize essential data structures.
4. Design and implement a normalized database schema.
5. Develop SQL skills for efficient database manipulation.

### Description:

The Library Management System project involves building a sophisticated system using object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, database design, SQL, and JDBC. The system will manage books, patrons, and transactions efficiently. JavaFX will be used to create a user-friendly interface, including forms for data input, tables for displaying information, and buttons for executing actions.

The project will feature:
- **OOP**: Define classes for books, patrons, and transactions, implement an inheritance hierarchy for different types of library resources, and utilize polymorphism to support various library operations.
- **Data Structures**: Implement linked lists for managing book lists and patron records, and use stacks and queues for transaction management, book reservations, and lending processes.
- **Database Design**: Design a normalized database schema to third normal form (3NF) to minimize data redundancy and ensure data consistency. Write SQL queries for creating tables, inserting data, and performing CRUD operations.
- **JDBC**: Establish and manage JDBC connections to the library database, execute SQL statements, and implement error handling and exception management strategies to ensure robustness and reliability.
